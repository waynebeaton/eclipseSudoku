Eclipse Sudoku
==============

This sample demonstrates how you can use Eclipse RCP to build a Sudoku Game. The sample can be used as either a standalone RCP application, or can be added to an Eclipse workbench where it manifests as a view. This is a fairly old code base (2008) based on an old version of Eclipse. But it does use standard APIs and so should still work.
